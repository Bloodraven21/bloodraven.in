## What You’ll Need
- **Aeropress**
- **Coffee Grinder**
- **Freshly Roasted Coffee** (ideally < 1 month old, no more than 6 weeks)
- **Hot Water**

---

## Brewing Styles
I like to brew my coffee in **two ways**:
1. **Hot Aeropress Coffee**  
2. **Iced Aeropress Coffee**  

Both use the **Inverted Aeropress Method**, but the difference lies in the amount of water and whether ice is added.

## 🔥 Hot Aeropress Coffee

- **Coffee:** 12.5g, freshly ground (light → medium roast)  
- **Water:** Boil, then let it rest for ~1 min before use  

### Steps
1. Invert the Aeropress.  
2. Add coffee grounds + 50ml of water.  
3. Let it bloom for **30 seconds**.  
4. Add **150–190ml** of water.  
5. Brew for:  
   - **Light roast:** 2 minutes (120s) + bloom → total **150s**  
   - **Medium roast:** 1.5 minutes (90s) + bloom → total **120s**  
6. Coffee-to-water ratio: **1:16 → 1:19.2**  
7. Invert and plunge gently into your cup.  

👉 You now have a **clean, aromatic hot brew**.

## ❄️ Iced Aeropress Coffee

Follow the **same steps as hot brew**, but with a twist:

- Add **100–150g of large ice cubes** to your cup before plunging.  
- The result is slightly more diluted but **sweeter and refreshing**.

✨ That’s it! This method gives you both **bright hot coffee** and **refreshing iced coffee** using the same inverted technique.
