This is my space for sharing things I’ve found valuable, inspiring, or just plain fun.  
Expect a mix of:  

- 📚 **Books** I’ve read (or want to read)  
- ☕ **Coffee gear & beans** I’ve tried and loved  
- 🎬 **Movies & TV shows** that left an impression  
- 🎞️ **Anime** I couldn’t stop watching  
- 🛠️ **Tools & tech** that make life easier

It’s a growing list — kind of like a personal library of discoveries.  
Feel free to explore and maybe you’ll find something new to enjoy too!
