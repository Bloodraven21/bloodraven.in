I'm a **Software Engineer 2 – Application DevOps** at **Mastercard, Gurugram, India**.  
I’m passionate about **Cloud, Containers, and Community** — always exploring ways to build, break, and improve systems.  

Outside of work, you’ll usually find me:
- Brewing **freshly ground coffee** with my trusty Aeropress ☕  
- Watching **movies, TV shows, and anime** 🎬  
- Trying (and failing, sometimes 😅) to get out of a **reading slump** 📚
